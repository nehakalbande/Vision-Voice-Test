            The yoga class makes me set the tone for the day.
             It really calms me down. Although a little early, I got a chance to learn Sudarshan Kriya, 
             which is proving beneficial to me. Pranamayam helps me to calm myself.
            Also the evening chanting helps a lot.

            Jai Gurudev, I am still learning and it's my baby step towards spritual path. 
            It provides a platform where you understand and connect with your body and mind. 
            I think it will lead me towards inner peace. üôè

            <p>
            I feel so fortunate that I got a wonderful opportunity to learn Sudarshan Kriya at the comfort of my home. I did the breath and meditation course out of curiosity. But the results that I have seen in my self over the time are amazing. I was so amazed to see the increase in my energy levels during the course itself. I have been able to overcome my anger and anxiety to a level where even my family members have seen the change. My teachers have been doing a wonderful job in bringing this wonderful change in so many lives. I highly recommend learning this life changing skill to everyone.
